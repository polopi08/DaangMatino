### Core Concept

A new proxy is created by calling `createProxyServer` and passing
an `options` object as argument ([valid properties are available here](lib/http-proxy.js#L26-L42))

```javascript
var httpProxy = require('http-proxy');

var proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer(options); 
```
†Unless listen(..) is invoked on the object, this does not create a webserver. See below.

An object will be returned with four methods:

* web `req, res, [options]` (used for proxying regular HTTP(S) requests)
* ws `req, socket, head, [options]` (used for proxying WS(S) requests)
* listen `port` (a function that wraps the object in a webserver, for your convenience)
* close `[callback]` (a function that closes the inner webserver and stops listening on given port)

It is then possible to proxy requests by calling these functions

```javascript
http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  proxy.web(req, res, { target: 'http:
});
```

Errors can be listened on either using the Event Emitter API

```javascript
proxy.on('error', function(e) {
  ...
});
```

or using the callback API

```javascript
proxy.web(req, res, { target: 'http:
```

When a request is proxied it follows two different pipelines ([available here](lib/http-proxy/passes))
which apply transformations to both the `req` and `res` object.
The first pipeline (incoming) is responsible for the creation and manipulation of the stream that connects your client to the target.
The second pipeline (outgoing) is responsible for the creation and manipulation of the stream that, from your target, returns data
to the client.

### Use Cases

#### Setup a basic stand-alone proxy server

```js
var http = require('http'),
    httpProxy = require('http-proxy');



httpProxy.createProxyServer({target:'http:




http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.write('request successfully proxied!' + '\n' + JSON.stringify(req.headers, true, 2));
  res.end();
}).listen(9000);
```
†Invoking listen(..) triggers the creation of a web server. Otherwise, just the proxy instance is created.

#### Setup a stand-alone proxy server with custom server logic
This example shows how you can proxy a request using your own HTTP server
and also you can put your own logic to handle the request.

```js
var http = require('http'),
    httpProxy = require('http-proxy');




var proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({});






var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  
  
  proxy.web(req, res, { target: 'http:
});

console.log("listening on port 5050")
server.listen(5050);
```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

#### Setup a stand-alone proxy server with proxy request header re-writing
This example shows how you can proxy a request using your own HTTP server that
modifies the outgoing proxy request by adding a special header.

```js
var http = require('http'),
    httpProxy = require('http-proxy');




var proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({});









proxy.on('proxyReq', function(proxyReq, req, res, options) {
  proxyReq.setHeader('X-Special-Proxy-Header', 'foobar');
});

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  
  
  proxy.web(req, res, {
    target: 'http:
  });
});

console.log("listening on port 5050")
server.listen(5050);
```

#### Modify a response from a proxied server
Sometimes when you have received a HTML/XML document from the server of origin you would like to modify it before forwarding it on.

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

#### Setup a stand-alone proxy server with latency

```js
var http = require('http'),
    httpProxy = require('http-proxy');




var proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer();





http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  
  setTimeout(function () {
    proxy.web(req, res, {
      target: 'http:
    });
  }, 500);
}).listen(8008);




http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.write('request successfully proxied to: ' + req.url + '\n' + JSON.stringify(req.headers, true, 2));
  res.end();
}).listen(9008);
```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

#### Using HTTPS
You can activate the validation of a secure SSL certificate to the target connection (avoid self-signed certs), just set `secure: true` in the options.

##### HTTPS -> HTTP

```js



httpProxy.createServer({
  target: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 9009
  },
  ssl: {
    key: fs.readFileSync('valid-ssl-key.pem', 'utf8'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('valid-ssl-cert.pem', 'utf8')
  }
}).listen(8009);
```

##### HTTPS -> HTTPS

```js



httpProxy.createServer({
  ssl: {
    key: fs.readFileSync('valid-ssl-key.pem', 'utf8'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('valid-ssl-cert.pem', 'utf8')
  },
  target: 'https:
  secure: true 
}).listen(443);
```

##### HTTP -> HTTPS (using a PKCS12 client certificate)

```js



httpProxy.createProxyServer({
  target: {
    protocol: 'https:',
    host: 'my-domain-name',
    port: 443,
    pfx: fs.readFileSync('path/to/certificate.p12'),
    passphrase: 'password',
  },
  changeOrigin: true,
}).listen(8000);
```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

#### Proxying WebSockets
You can activate the websocket support for the proxy using `ws:true` in the options.

```js



httpProxy.createServer({
  target: 'ws:
  ws: true
}).listen(8014);
```

Also you can proxy the websocket requests just calling the `ws(req, socket, head)` method.

```js



var proxy = new httpProxy.createProxyServer({
  target: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 9015
  }
});
var proxyServer = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  proxy.web(req, res);
});





proxyServer.on('upgrade', function (req, socket, head) {
  proxy.ws(req, socket, head);
});

proxyServer.listen(8015);
```

### Options

`httpProxy.createProxyServer` supports the following options:

*  **target**: url string to be parsed with the url module
*  **forward**: url string to be parsed with the url module
*  **agent**: object to be passed to http(s).request (see Node's [https agent](http:
*  **ssl**: object to be passed to https.createServer()
*  **ws**: true/false, if you want to proxy websockets
*  **xfwd**: true/false, adds x-forward headers
*  **secure**: true/false, if you want to verify the SSL Certs
*  **toProxy**: true/false, passes the absolute URL as the `path` (useful for proxying to proxies)
*  **prependPath**: true/false, Default: true - specify whether you want to prepend the target's path to the proxy path
*  **ignorePath**: true/false, Default: false - specify whether you want to ignore the proxy path of the incoming request (note: you will have to append / manually if required).
*  **localAddress**: Local interface string to bind for outgoing connections
*  **changeOrigin**: true/false, Default: false - changes the origin of the host header to the target URL
*  **preserveHeaderKeyCase**: true/false, Default: false - specify whether you want to keep letter case of response header key
*  **auth**: Basic authentication i.e. 'user:password' to compute an Authorization header.
*  **hostRewrite**: rewrites the location hostname on (201/301/302/307/308) redirects.
*  **autoRewrite**: rewrites the location host/port on (201/301/302/307/308) redirects based on requested host/port. Default: false.
*  **protocolRewrite**: rewrites the location protocol on (201/301/302/307/308) redirects to 'http' or 'https'. Default: null.
*  **cookieDomainRewrite**: rewrites domain of `set-cookie` headers. Possible values:
   * `false` (default): disable cookie rewriting
   * String: new domain, for example `cookieDomainRewrite: "new.domain"`. To remove the domain, use `cookieDomainRewrite: ""`.
   * Object: mapping of domains to new domains, use `"*"` to match all domains.
     For example keep one domain unchanged, rewrite one domain and remove other domains:
     ```
     cookieDomainRewrite: {
       "unchanged.domain": "unchanged.domain",
       "old.domain": "new.domain",
       "*": ""
     }
     ```
*  **cookiePathRewrite**: rewrites path of `set-cookie` headers. Possible values:
   * `false` (default): disable cookie rewriting
   * String: new path, for example `cookiePathRewrite: "/newPath/"`. To remove the path, use `cookiePathRewrite: ""`. To set path to root use `cookiePathRewrite: "/"`.
   * Object: mapping of paths to new paths, use `"*"` to match all paths.
     For example, to keep one path unchanged, rewrite one path and remove other paths:
     ```
     cookiePathRewrite: {
       "/unchanged.path/": "/unchanged.path/",
       "/old.path/": "/new.path/",
       "*": ""
     }
     ```
*  **headers**: object with extra headers to be added to target requests.
*  **proxyTimeout**: timeout (in millis) for outgoing proxy requests
*  **timeout**: timeout (in millis) for incoming requests
*  **followRedirects**: true/false, Default: false - specify whether you want to follow redirects
*  **selfHandleResponse** true/false, if set to true, none of the webOutgoing passes are called and it's your responsibility to appropriately return the response by listening and acting on the `proxyRes` event
*  **buffer**: stream of data to send as the request body.  Maybe you have some middleware that consumes the request stream before proxying it on e.g.  If you read the body of a request into a field called 'req.rawbody' you could restream this field in the buffer option:

    ```
    'use strict';

    const streamify = require('stream-array');
    const HttpProxy = require('http-proxy');
    const proxy = new HttpProxy();

    module.exports = (req, res, next) => {

      proxy.web(req, res, {
        target: 'http:
        buffer: streamify(req.rawBody)
      }, next);

    };
    ```

**NOTE:**
`options.ws` and `options.ssl` are optional.
`options.target` and `options.forward` cannot both be missing

If you are using the `proxyServer.listen` method, the following options are also applicable:

 *  **ssl**: object to be passed to https.createServer()
 *  **ws**: true/false, if you want to proxy websockets


**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Listening for proxy events

* `error`: The error event is emitted if the request to the target fail. **We do not do any error handling of messages passed between client and proxy, and messages passed between proxy and target, so it is recommended that you listen on errors and handle them.**
* `proxyReq`: This event is emitted before the data is sent. It gives you a chance to alter the proxyReq request object. Applies to "web" connections
* `proxyReqWs`: This event is emitted before the data is sent. It gives you a chance to alter the proxyReq request object. Applies to "websocket" connections
* `proxyRes`: This event is emitted if the request to the target got a response.
* `open`: This event is emitted once the proxy websocket was created and piped into the target websocket.
* `close`: This event is emitted once the proxy websocket was closed.
* (DEPRECATED) `proxySocket`: Deprecated in favor of `open`.

```js
var httpProxy = require('http-proxy');




var proxy = httpProxy.createServer({
  target:'http:
});

proxy.listen(8005);



proxy.on('error', function (err, req, res) {
  res.writeHead(500, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
  });

  res.end('Something went wrong. And we are reporting a custom error message.');
});




proxy.on('proxyRes', function (proxyRes, req, res) {
  console.log('RAW Response from the target', JSON.stringify(proxyRes.headers, true, 2));
});




proxy.on('open', function (proxySocket) {
  
  proxySocket.on('data', hybiParseAndLogMessage);
});




proxy.on('close', function (res, socket, head) {
  
  console.log('Client disconnected');
});
```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Shutdown

* When testing or running server within another program it may be necessary to close the proxy.
* This will stop the proxy from accepting new connections.

```js
var proxy = new httpProxy.createProxyServer({
  target: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 1337
  }
});

proxy.close();
```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Miscellaneous

If you want to handle your own response after receiving the `proxyRes`, you can do
so with `selfHandleResponse`. As you can see below, if you use this option, you
are able to intercept and read the `proxyRes` but you must also make sure to
reply to the `res` itself otherwise the original client will never receive any
data.

### Modify response

```js

    var option = {
      target: target,
      selfHandleResponse : true
    };
    proxy.on('proxyRes', function (proxyRes, req, res) {
        var body = [];
        proxyRes.on('data', function (chunk) {
            body.push(chunk);
        });
        proxyRes.on('end', function () {
            body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
            console.log("res from proxied server:", body);
            res.end("my response to cli");
        });
    });
    proxy.web(req, res, option);


```
